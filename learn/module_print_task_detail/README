This program is to print details of 'task_struct' based on the passed 'tgid'.

Background:

    -   In Linux, everything is executed as a thread and the same is represented
        as 'task_struct' structure in Linux kernel.

    -   A program, which does not explicitly create a thread using
        'pthread_create' also has a thread.

    -   Linux scheduler schedules differnet threads, available in the form of
        'task_struct' sturctures in the linux kernel.

    -   'pthread_create()' creates a new thread(task_struct), which use the same
        memory regions of the thread which created it.

    -   'fork()' also creates a new thread(task_struct), which does NOT use the
        same region of the thread which created it. Newly created thread with
        'fork()' has its own memory regions.

    -   Every thread's pid (task_struct->pid) is different. For example, if the
        first thread creates another four threads, all five threads(task_struct)
        will have their own different 'pid'.

    -   Every thread (task_struct) has 'tgid' (thread group id) as well, along
        with 'pid'. This 'tgid' is same as 'pid' of the first thread that was
        created when the program was loaded in memory and started. Hence, as per
        the last example, all five threads will have 'tgid' same as the 'pid' of
        the first thread.

    -   Dont rely on 'getpid()' inside a thread execution. It just gives you the
        'pid' of the main thread. Means, 'tgid' of this group of the threads.

    -   All tasks which use the same memory regions are hierarichally
        represented. Check at the end of this README for more detail on how
        other threads are represented for the first created thread.

Below is the core logic of the program which iterate through all the
'task_struct' nodes of the task list, and find the node with the pid and also
find the 'task_struct' nodes for the related threads then just print details of
the same.

static void print_task_info(unsigned int tgid)
{
    struct task_struct *the_process;
    struct task_struct *the_thread;
    char comm[TASK_COMM_LEN];

    rcu_read_lock();
    for_each_process(the_process) {
        if (task_tgid_nr(the_process) == tgid) {
            pr_info("process node: %p\n", the_process);
            for_each_thread(the_process, the_thread) {
                pr_info("thread node: %p\t Name: %s\t PID:[%d]\t TGID:[%d]\t STATE:[%s]\n",
                        the_thread, get_task_comm(comm, the_thread),
                        task_pid_nr(the_thread), task_tgid_nr(the_thread),
                        get_task_state(the_thread->state));
            }
            break;
        }
    }
    rcu_read_unlock();
    return;
}

Function 'for_each_process' traverse through all the nodes of global task link
list, which is a doubly link list.  With the use of 'for_each_process' we can
find out and print the details of a specific 'pid' number.

Function 'for_each_thread' traverse through all the threads task_struct's.

Here, the global list of the 'task_struct', you can assume as all the processes
in the device, and all the internal list of 'task_struct' represent the list
of all threads.

Below is the process of building, loading and usage of the module.

Module build:
------------

[ ] make

Module load:
------------

[ ] insmode mymodule.ko

Module usage:
------------

This module has a parameter and a callback written for it. Once we load this
module in the linux kernel, there is a parameter created with this path,
'/sys/module/mymodule/parameters/arg'.

After loading this module, when you put some value to this parameter using
'echo', it will invoke the callback function and take the value from the arg,
and pass it down to 'print_task_info' to get the details about that task.
Hence, do this,

echo 'pid' > /sys/module/mymodule/parameters/arg

for example,

echo 4463 >  /sys/module/mymodule/parameters/arg

It will simply perint the details about this process number '4463'. You can
check it with 'dmesg | tail'.

[ ] dmesg | tail
[ 1765.202841] process node: 000000007516bd93
[ 1765.202847] thread node: 000000007516bd93	 Name: a.out	 PID:[3263]	 TGID:[3263]	 STATE:[TASK_RUNNING]
[ 1765.202850] thread node: 0000000060f89353	 Name: a.out	 PID:[3264]	 TGID:[3263]	 STATE:[TASK_RUNNING]
[ 1765.202852] thread node: 0000000081d1d95a	 Name: a.out	 PID:[3265]	 TGID:[3263]	 STATE:[TASK_RUNNING]
[ 1765.202854] thread node: 0000000042b65549	 Name: a.out	 PID:[3266]	 TGID:[3263]	 STATE:[TASK_RUNNING]
[ 1765.202856] thread node: 0000000072af4703	 Name: a.out	 PID:[3267]	 TGID:[3263]	 STATE:[TASK_RUNNING]

Note : All Linux threads are maintained in hierarchal form.
"(task_struct *)->signal->thread_head" is the list of all threads, which belongs
to the same tgid(thread group id, which is actually the PID of main thread).

 'threads link list'  'threads link list'  'threads link list'
    (task_struct)       (task_struct)        (task_struct)

So, here you can see that there is one top link list of the all the
'main threads' created as part of different processes and each node of this link
list contains a pointer to 'signal', and this 'signal' pointer has link list of
all the threads (task_struct). The very first element in this 'threads link
list' is the 'Main thread' task_struct structure.

Note : The 'pid' of the main task becomes 'tgid' for all the tasks which share
the same virtual memory/resources.
